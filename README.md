# 💪 X Power

**X Power** is a landing page for a bodybuilding website, designed using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📋 Project Overview
The project is based on a Figma file: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/YtrdOJ18JLK2HBci4PcpKA/Botostart-UI-Examples---Free?node-id=1-9864&node-type=frame&t=VEyWfX1PIdHdjQSA-0), which initially only supported a desktop version. However, thanks to the developer's experience and passion for optimization, the design has been made fully responsive. 💻📱

## ✨ Features
- 🖥️ **Responsive Design:** The initial Figma design only supported desktop, but it has been optimized to work on multiple screen sizes.
- ⚛️ **React & Tailwind CSS:** Built using React for the UI and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- 🖼️ **Optimized Images:** Compressed images are used due to the lack of a backend, and all assets are handled directly in the frontend.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **React**: For building the user interface.
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**: For flexible and modern styling.
- 🖼️ **Figma**: Design source.
