# X Power

**X Power** is a landing page for a bodybuilding website, designed using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Project Overview
The project is based on a Figma file: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/YtrdOJ18JLK2HBci4PcpKA/Botostart-UI-Examples---Free?node-id=1-9864&node-type=frame&t=VEyWfX1PIdHdjQSA-0), which initially only supported a desktop version. However, thanks to the developer's experience and passion for optimization, the design has been made fully responsive.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The initial Figma design only supported desktop, but it has been optimized to work on multiple screen sizes.
- **React & Tailwind CSS:** Built using React for the UI and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **No Backend:** As the project lacks a backend, lightweight, compressed images have been used, and all objects are handled directly in the frontend.
